Attack Animations:
I have put together a collection of LPC weapon slash animations. For the parts of this pack created/adapted by me, you can credit me as Michael Whitlock as well as the original artist. I have introduced some missing female frames (I disagree with makrohn's assertion that the spears and bows in the github repos "just work", so I have fixed those as well. I have also added 20 new melee weapons adapted from Reemax's LPC Items. 4 weapon types and 5 color styles.
